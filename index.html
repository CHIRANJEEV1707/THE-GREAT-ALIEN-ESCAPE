            IT IS A TYPE ACTION, ADVENTUE AND ROLE PLAYING GAME. IN THIS GAME YOU PLAY AS A ALIEN NAMED "GALLEN" WHO IS TRAPPED ON UNKNOWN PLANET.
            BUT THE ALIENS OVER THERE ARE NOT HELPING HIM TO LEAVE RATHER THEY ARE BEHIND HIS LIFE SO THAT THEY CAN GET HIS POWERS AND TECHNOLOGIES.
            YOU AS GALLEN HAVE TO FIGHT THOSE ALIENS OR WE CAN SAY ENEMIES TO RETURN BACK TO YOUR PLANET. IN THIS GAME YOU WILL BE EXPOSED TO NEW CHALLENGES EVERYTIME YOU CLEAR THE OBJECTIVES OF THE CURRENT STAGE.

        <CENTER>
          AS THIS GAME IS A PROTOTYPE OR WE CAN SAY A DEMO OF THE FINAL GAME THERE ARE MANY THINGS AND FEATURES TO BE ADDED IN IT.
          IT IS MADE ON CODE.ORG SO THERE WERE SOME PROBLEMS WHILE MAKING IT. I HAD CREATED 3 STAGES FOR 'THE GREAT ALIEN ESCAPE' DUE TO WHICH A LOT OF CODES WERE WRITTEN.
          DUE TO, TOO MANY CODES THE CODE.ORG WAS LAGGING A LOT AND WE WERE NOT ABLE TO PLAY THE GAME PROPERLY. SO I DELETED THE 2 STAGES AND KEPT ONLY THE FIRST STAGE.
          IN THIS STAGE THERE ARE MANY THINGS TO BE ADDED AND FEW THINGS TO BE CORRECTED.
